(They are a terrier after all, and all terriers were bred to chase and kill something.) You probably won’t find them chasing rats anymore, but they do love to play and give and receive attention and quite happy to sit pretty as a lapdog.",

Despite their fearsome reputation, most owners find they are loyal, docile, obedient, and a loving family pet. It is because of their intelligence that German Shepherds are trained for military service, search and rescue, and police dogs. After World War I, returning soldiers spoke so highly of this breed that their popularity exploded in the United States. ",

The Frenchie is a brachycephalic breed, which means its shorter snouts make breathing a little more laborious, especially in hot weather or if your Frenchie takes a dip in the lake. But the Frenchie’s natural inclination to be a champion couch potato suits it’s breathing condition so it won’t have issues there. When they do want to cool off and relax they lay with their legs splayed out behind them, earning another nickname, “Frog Dog.”",

Male Rottweilers are calm and always on duty, watching for threats to their home and human family but females are a little more chill and more affectionate.
